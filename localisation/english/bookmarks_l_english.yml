 great_wakes_NAME:0 "Great Wakes"
 great_wakes_DESC:0 "Five and a half years have passed since the Allied defeat at Normandy. The worst had truly come to pass, the Uranprojekt had produced a bomb. The United Kingdom falls into disarray and sues for peace with dissident servicemen and politicians fleeing to Canada. The Ottawa Treaty Organization continues the fight in the West, but without a foothold in Europe there is little they can do. Simultaneously in the East, the Wermacht wastes no time employing its nuclear arms and routes the Red Army behind the Urals."
